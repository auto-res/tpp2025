As a slightly unusual exercise in formalizing computability, consider Turing machines with cyclic tapes. Submit your solutions to the organizer—partial answers and updates are welcome.

## Tasks

1. **Define cyclic-tape Turing machines.**  
   A cyclic tape is a fixed-length tape whose ends are connected. You may rely on any standard Turing-machine definition.
2. **Define the one-step computation** for such machines.
3. **Define a halting predicate** stating that the machine halts on a given input tape.
4. **Construct a clearing machine** that takes an unknown-length cyclic tape, clears it to all zeros, and halts (you may assume a minimum tape length). This puzzle originates from Vincent van Oostrom.
5. **Demonstrate the machine** on a concrete input tape.
6. **(Optional) Prove correctness:** show that the machine halts and leaves the tape cleared for every input.
