# TPPmark23 — N-in-a-Row on an Infinite Board

Two players (first and second) alternately place stones on the points of an infinite Go board. A player wins once they occupy `N` consecutive points in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.

## Tasks

1. **Formalize the N-in-a-row game.**
2. **Show that the second player has no winning strategy.**
3. **Show that, for sufficiently large `N`, the first player has no winning strategy.**
   - Hint: A pairing strategy proves the claim for `N ≥ 9`.
   - Reference: L. Győr.y, G. Makay, A. Pluhár, *The pairing strategies of the 9-in-a-row game*.
