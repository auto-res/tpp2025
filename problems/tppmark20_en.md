These problems are designed for SAT/SMT solver exploration, but they also admit pencil-and-paper proofs. Please send solutions to `nakasho@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp`.

## Problem 1

Consider colouring the 124 vectors in  
`X = { (x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈ {0, ±1, ±√2} } \ {(0, 0, 0)}`  
either black or white. Prove that no colouring can satisfy both conditions simultaneously:

- `a)` Among any two orthogonal vectors, at least one is coloured black.
- `b)` Among any three mutually orthogonal vectors, at least one is coloured white.

## Problem 2

Remove as many vectors as possible from `X` while ensuring that condition `c)` still holds but at least one of conditions `a)` or `b)` fails. (Hint: It is known that you can remove vectors until only 33 remain.)

- `c)` The set contains at least one triple of mutually orthogonal vectors.

## Problem 3

Extend the challenge to `n` dimensions for `n > 3`. Construct a set of `n`-dimensional vectors such that condition `c')` holds yet at least one of `a)` or `b')` fails. Constructions for specific values of `n` are also welcome.

- `a)` Among any two orthogonal vectors, at least one is coloured black.
- `b')` Among any `n` mutually orthogonal vectors, at least one is coloured white.
- `c')` The set contains at least one collection of `n` mutually orthogonal vectors.
